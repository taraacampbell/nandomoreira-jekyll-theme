A cookie, when talking about websites, is like a post-it note. A post-it note that sticks to you and tracks everything from your customization to the username and password you use to log in. The cookie sends information back and forth from the browser to the server to keep the server notified of your activity. The post-it writes what you’re doing and sends it to the server, which then copies that information down. They’re useful when choosing what ads to show you, ie an outdoors store if the cookie tells the server that you’ve been on national park websites and shopping for hiking shoes. This can be alarming to some people, because they feel spied on, but in reality cookies can’t be used to track more than your email address and your interests. They cannot be used to locate someone.

Some websites don’t use them, so you’re not always being tracked, but a fair amount do. You can also turn off cookies for any given site. When visiting a site that uses cookies, it attaches a post-it with an ID tag in the browser so it keeps a running tally of your movements and information. A similar ID tag with the same number is stored in the website, which is housed on a server (or multiple), so that they have the same information.
 
When you revisit a website it can search for the ID number it gave you last time, and all of your features are there. This is called a persistent cookie. It is always stored, and it has your history of when you were last on the site. A session cookie is not always there. It stays and tracks you while you’re on the website, but is deleted after you leave.

When on a website, it’s called a session, or a visit. Whoever is in charge of the website decides how long a session is, for example thirty minutes, and if a user comes back within thirty minutes, it’s still the same session. If they come back forty minutes later, it’s another session. These sessions tell the server how much traffic a website is getting.
