A website is like a dictionary, made up of many different pages all with ways to direct you to other pages i.e. cow a fully grown animal from ox descent (see animal). Then you could go to animal and read about that definition. A website works the same way. If I am looking at the employee page, I could click on a certain employee and read about him on his single page.

The different pages are held on multiple servers, and are connected by links we make through code. The pages are made up of HTML and can be accessed by HTTP, a protocol to pull and push different pages and forms through servers and web browsers. Whatever you want to access through HTTP comes up through a web browser, ie Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.

A website is the dictionary, and a webpage is a certain page within that “book” that we can be routed to. However, the webpages can be stored all over in different servers, instead of in one large “book” or server in our case.

As programmers, we can optimize the speed of a website by streamlining our code. By adding multiple views, it takes longer for a page to load, since it has to run through each view and look at the code instead of it being all on one page. Also redirecting to other pages in our code causes the speed to change.

Without touching the code, we can speed up the load time through a CDN, a Content Distribution Network. They take copies of your code and distribute it to different data centers, so that people can access your site through different servers, limiting heavy traffic through one data center.

A website is hosted in a web-hosting server, like an empty room. It can host anything, but a person has to put it all there, like us putting code to make up a website.
