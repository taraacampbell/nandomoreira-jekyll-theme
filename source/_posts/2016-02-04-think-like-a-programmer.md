I think the growth mindset is key in all aspects of life, especially programming, which is something I’m unfamiliar with. I’ve always liked problem solving, so I figured programming would be a good fit.

Any problem that I take on I approach with a blank slate—I have to remind myself that I have the ability to solve it, and just using the right tools is going to make it easy. If I’m told it’s a harder problem, then I may doubt myself when I get an answer, so I tend to ignore the difficulty of things when working through any problem set.

I’ve found the same in programming: if somewhere it says “this is going to be a little harder,” I zone out because I feel like I’m not at an advanced level. One time in class Ms. Pilgrim said that one of the questions was tricky, but I’d already done it, so I figured I was wrong. When I realized that I had in fact done it correctly, I was more confident that I could tackle other more difficult programming methods. The tools are all there for us; whether it’s on google, on Roman Net or our notes, the way to approach a programming problem is accessible, we just have to seek it out.

Even in the short month that we’ve done programming, I feel much more confident. I knew that I knew nothing and was coming in completely blind, but in a way it was good. I thought to myself, I can only go up from here, and that I have. This is a key to the growth mindset: you can only get better. I am much more comfortable with methods, mostly because I’ve learned to think of them as things that happen in real life. Like one of the sources I read said, learning to think of modern day technology and even simple engineering feats as a program can help you do your own programming. I can equate a method to what message pops up on a car dashboard: puts “Car Company.” Or even a randomizer online: it’s an array with an iteration. Finding small things to relate back to programming make the whole concept much easier to grasp and therefore do.
