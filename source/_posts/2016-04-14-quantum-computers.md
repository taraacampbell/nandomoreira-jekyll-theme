According to Moore’s Law, “the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit will double approximately every two years.” A transistor is something that amplifies a signal, and is a fundamental building block of all modern electronics. The output can be much greater than the input, so it is able to control many terminals with a weaker input than needed due to the transistor’s ability to create a stronger output. 

Transistors can also turn on and off switches to control a computer chip. Transistors paved the way for smaller-scale electronics, like a handheld calculator among other things, because they were able to minimize the amount of “stuff” transmitting signals within the device. They also make up a large part of integrated circuits, or what are commonly known as microchips. To give a scale, a transistor has been manufactures can be 7nm, which is just a little bigger than a strand of DNA, so there are billions of transistors within each microchip, controlling the switchboard.

A microchip defines the computing power of a computer. The more transistors a microchip has, the more it can control, and at the same time. To be faster, we want to pack as many transistors in as possible, and naturally, make everything smaller. Because of Moore’s Law, in 2020 or 2030, the size of would transistors need to be at the atomic level.

That’s where research into quantum computers comes in. Instead of using silicon, what computer processors are made up of nowadays, they will harness power within atoms to make processing speeds much faster. A quantum computer has already been created by scientists at a basic level for small-scale calculations, but a practical one has not been created yet. These quantum computers can preform many calculations simultaneously, instead of one by one at rapid speeds, so we get exponentially more calculations being done.
